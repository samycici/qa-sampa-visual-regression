# Pokedex App

A pokedex web app using AngularJS and [Pokeapi.co](http://pokeapi.co/).

This app was based in <https://github.com/alvarowolfx/ng-pokedex/> with some adjusts and a new 404 page.

## Pre requirements

- Node.js and NPM installed (I recommend to do something like [this](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md) to install global packages without sudo )

## How to run

- Install required npm packages, run this command on project folder :

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

- Start livereload server

  ```shell
  npm start
  ```
